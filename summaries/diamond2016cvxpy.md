# [CVXPY: A Python-Embedded Modeling Language for Convex Optimization (Diamond 2016)](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxpy_paper.pdf)

CVXPY converts problems into conic form by using Grant and Boyd's graph
implementation methodology (note that this will not be true for all
problems in CVXPY 1.0). CVXPY therefore interfaces only with cone solvers.
Convexity is verified via disciplined convex programming.
